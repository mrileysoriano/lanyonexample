# Background and Objectives
The Radical Periodical Index draws inspiration from pioneering digitization efforts such as the Modernist Journals Project, The Colored American Magazine digital archive, and marxists.org's extensive periodical repository. Despite these valuable initiatives, access to radical leftist textual materials from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries remains significantly limited in the digital landscape.

While resources like marxists.org and libcom.org provide invaluable materials for scholars, they contain considerable gaps in their periodical coverage. The Alarm (1884-1889)—one of the most significant socialist and anarchist periodicals of its era—exemplifies this problem. Despite its historical importance, it currently lacks any comprehensive index, meaningful metadata, or systematic documentation of its contents. Though fragments of its articles and essays can be found scattered across various online sources, no centralized repository exists for academics researching this crucial period of American radical history.

This gap is particularly significant given the renewed scholarly interest in Albert and Lucy Parsons, who served as editors and contributors to The Alarm. Albert Parsons has received substantial scholarly attention throughout the twentieth century due to his involvement in the Haymarket affair and his subsequent execution. Lucy Parsons has gained increasing critical attention in the twenty-first century, as scholars examine her complex position as a Black, Indigenous anarchist woman writer and thinker. Despite this growing interest, significant barriers remain to accessing and examining their most influential periodical work. Currently, The Alarm is exclusively available as a series of Microfilms housed at various libraries across the United States. The goal of the Radical Periodical Index is to make those microfilm negatives digitally accessible, cataloged, and indexed for future scholarly use.

# Project Goals
In the summer of 2024, I was awarded a University of Miami Digital Humanities Summer Fellowship to visit the Newberry Library and secure microfilm copies of The Alarm. Through this project, I am digitally reproducing complete issues of The Alarm—accompanied by detailed, issue-by-issue tables of contents—to make them freely accessible to scholars, students, and the wider public.

My hope is that this project will serve both the academic community and anyone interested in the history of radical politics by:

- Creating a comprehensive digital archive of this significant anarchist periodical
- Providing detailed metadata and content indexing to facilitate research
- Making visible the contributions of important radical thinkers like the Parsons
- Supporting new scholarship on nineteenth-century radical political thought
- Democratizing access to materials previously available only in specialized archives
- The Radical Periodical Index represents a focused intervention in addressing the uneven landscape of digital archival access, particularly for materials that document alternative political visions and social movements.

# Navigating the Site
Radical Periodical Index is currently focused on the Chicago-based Anarchist periodical "The Alarm." In time, we may expand our scope to include other periodicals.

The site is composed of six sections:

- Issues
  - This contains The Alarm's individual issues. Each issue includes relevant citational information, a table of contents for the issue (when one can be produced), TIFF image downloads, and an in-browser document viewer.
- Volumes
  - Contains The Alarm's five volumes with each respective issue contained within its corresponding volume. 
- Exhibits
  - The exhibits section is the site's most speculative element. It will ideally serve as a space to showcase creative readings of, or projects/educational materials on, The Alarm. We hope to generate material for this section over time. 
- About, People, and Resources
  - Supplementary and Metatextual information not directly tied to the Radical Periodical Index.
