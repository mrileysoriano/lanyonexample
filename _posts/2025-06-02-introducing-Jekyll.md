title: Introducing Markdown & Jekyll
---

As you may have already seen during our experiments with Markdown, GitHub, and Jekyll, you will need to attend to some formatting complexities when writing and creating with these tools. For instance, here are a couple of headers:

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

If you want a link, you could simply do [this](https://mrileysoriano.github.io/lanyonexample//CDSsi/). By clicking on that link, you will be redirected to a different area of the site. Additionally, and as you will see during our live demonstration, Jekyll is a "blog-enabled" tool. So, when visiting my repository for this site, you will see that the file titles are pretty specific. Jekyll needs "posts" to be written with dates first. The dates must also be accurate because if you write a date from sometime in the future, it will not display that post _until_ the date you entered.

Here are some examples of Jekyll file syntax:
- "2025-06-01-Hello-World.md"
- "2025-06-02-Hello-Again.md"

The ".md" signifies that this is a Markdown file. Jekyll usually displays dates in descending order (newer dates will appear first). That's why the example site for Lanyon shows "2020-04-03" for the "Introducing Lanyon" post. By placing that date (which could be entirely arbitrary), that post will be the first one that a user sees.
